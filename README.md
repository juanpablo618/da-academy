### Learning Days ###

During each week you will grab the fundamentals of the key building blocks for usual DA challenges.

On each topic you will have to:

1. ### Enroll courses: ###
Each week counts with a special course link which you can visit to enroll it.

2. ### Read: ###
We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the following practice.

3. ### Practice: ###
You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding/setting up activities.
Most important task numbers are listed in the "*Key Points*" section for each day and they should get most of your attention; if you feel you don’t have enough time to complete all tasks, start with these ones when possible.

4. ### Commit: ###
You will commit all your code on a daily basis, when you finish your practice.

→ [index](#index)

### Individual performance ###

After each lecture, you will be given several related exercices which act like a bonus. 

General requirements:

1. Corrections will be made against your fork **master** branch. You can create any additional branch for testing purposes, but ensure your latest changes are in the main branch.

2. Exercices should be solved **individually**.   

3. Extra **documentation** is recommended (e.g., create a *spring_comments.txt* file indicating what has been done and where within your project).

4. After each topic, you will find two types of exercices. The **Practice** section is considered mandatory for everyone. The **Challenges!!** section is optional (of course, try to tackle it too. Every additional task acts like a bonus).

5. There's an **Auto assessment** section after each subject which will help you understand how you're doing. If this becomes too difficult, then you should go back and make a second read. This said, try not to leave concepts/exercices for the end. Every subject is important and it helps (in some way, it is required) to understand the following subject.  

### Prepare your environment ###

In order to test and run Spark and Hadoop exercices, you will need to download a Virtual Machine. Further instructions on how to download this can be found in [here](exercices/Download_Virtual_Machine.pdf)

# Week 0: Python and Linux

→ [index](#index)

### Practice: ###

#### Before you begin ####
(It is assumed that Git is already installed and working).

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Initialize a simple project in your local repository. 
4. Update *.gitignore* file, not to upload */target* folder nor any undesirable and unneeded file.
5. Upload your code with whatever changes you've made. You will upload your individual progress in your master branch. You can also create additional branches for testing/other purposes. Corrections will be only made against your master branch.
6. Every practice functionality must be validated through unit tests. Use the [pytest package](https://pytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html) to make these tests.

#### Exercices ####

1. **Linux basics**: Answer the following questions:

- What command would you use to count the amount of occurrences of the word ​Unix ​in a file? How would make the command case insensitive?
- What command would you use to constantly see the last 100 lines appended to a file that contain the word ​*"ERROR"*​?

2. **Python Basics**: Matrix Calculation

Create a class which allows to represent a matrix of any order or shape (n x n, n x m). It should also allow the following operations with matrices:

- Matrices addition
- Scalar multiplication 
- Matrices multiplication
- Matrix transpose
- Matrix determinant
- Adjugate matrix
- Inverted matrix

Add additional methods:

- A method to obtain a matrix row. Do not return repeated rows. E.g., you can specify that the rows 1,3,8 are desired from a 20x10 matrix.

- A method to obtain a matrix column. Do not return repeated columns. E.g., you can specify that the columns 2,4,10 are desired from a 20x10 matrix.

- A method to obtain part of the matrix from a certain column. E.g., from a 10x10 matrix, the 10x2 matrix from column 5 is desired.

- A method to show the matrix on screen as a matrix.

A 3x6 matrix can be defined at the class instantiation time like this:
Matrix([[1,2,3,4,5,6],
	[10,11,12,13,14,15],
	[-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6]])

Do not use the numpy package for this implementation. Just use the Standard Library.

# Week 1: Storage

### Motivation ###

Chosing the most appropriate data model for your project is not trivial. As a DA, you are expected to be able to define what are the pros and cons of each model for your use case and make the final choice.

### What you will learn ###

To begin with, we can classify data models in two big groups: relational and NoSQL databases. Here you will learn the fundamentals of each, with some specific implementations details.

### Reading: ###

1. [Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197)

2. [NoSQL - Acamica](https://globant.acamica.com/cursos/412/)

3. [NoSQL Fundamentals Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d8DYf6F9p74Cm5hvPwo6njdGazu01y4sqZG1mmIxLWY/edit)

→ [index](#index)

### Practice: ###

1. Create your project DB with whichever SQL db you prefer. From now on, data should be retrieved from/persisted in/deleted from there.
2. Create a database named 'high-school' and modelate:
 
   - Student: first name, last name, registration number, date of birth
   - Teacher: first name, last name, date of birth
   - Course: name, assigned teacher, hours by week, schedule time (they can be dictated several times during the week)

   Notes:
   - A student can assist several courses during the same year.
   - A teacher can be assigned to several courses.
   - For each course, each student has 3 partial notes and a final note.
   - Create all relationship that you think they are required.

3. Insert information for 3 teachers, 3 courses and 10 students per course.
4. List students and teachers for a given course. The output format should be:

        Course: <course-name>
        Teacher: <last-name>, <first-name>
        Students:
          <last-name>, <first-name> (ordered by alphabetically by last name)

5. Percentage of students that passed/failed a given course.
6. For a given teacher, list the timeline for each course that he is assigned to (ordered by date), and the course name. The format should be:

        Teacher: <last-name>, <first-name>
        Schedule:
          Monday 09:00 - 11:00: <course-name>
          Monday 15:00 - 17:30: <course-name>
          Friday 08:45 - 10:40: <course-name>

### Motivation ###

### What you will learn ###

### Reading: ###

1. [Spark Basics](https://www.udemy.com/spark-basics/)

2. [Spark Starter Kit](https://www.udemy.com/sparkstarterkit/)

### Practice: ###

#### Before you begin ####
(It is assumed that Git is already installed and working).

#### Exercices ####

1. **Python and PySpark**

During the following exercise you will need to combine Python 3 and PySpark. You will be analyzing Apache access log files.

*A*. Create a Python 3 script that receives three parameters: a base URL, a list of files and a directory and downloads the files from that base URL to the given path:

https://github.com/XXXXXX.log.gz

https://github.com/XXXXXX.log1.gz

https://github.com/XXXXXX.log2.gz

*B*. Create a PySpark script that reads the files downloaded in the previous exercise and uses the code supplied below to parse each line to a PySpark Dataframe filters the lines that don’t have google, ask or yahoo as referers and writes the resulting Dataframe to disk in
Parquet format.

*C*. Create a PySpark script that reads the resulting Parquet files from the previous exercise, loads them to a Dataframe, registers a Spark SQL temp table, queries it to obtain the top 20 hosts by access count and writes the information to a new location in json format.

*D*. Create a PySpark script that reads the resulting Parquet files from exercise 2, loads them to a Dataframe and generates a Matplotlib pie chart that shows the percentage of occurrence of each status code.

2. **Spark and Twitter**

Create a Python script application that reads from the public Twitter stream API and publishes tweet messages in JSON format to a different file each minute. This application should receive a list of terms as a parameter to filter the stream (check Twitter API track parameter).

# Week 4: Cloud Ecosystem

### Motivation ###

The term *“cloud”* has been used in many different contexts and it has many different definitions, so it makes sense to define the term at least for this course.

Cloud is a collection of services that helps developers focus on their project rather than on the infrastructure that powers it. 

In more concrete terms, cloud services are things like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) or Google Compute Engine (GCE), which provide APIs to provision virtual servers, where customers pay per hour for the use of these servers.

In many ways, cloud is the next layer of abstraction in computer infrastructure, where computing, storage, analytics, networking, and more are all pushed higher up the computing stack. This structure takes the focus of the developer away from CPUs and RAM and toward APIs for higher-level operations such as storing or querying for data. 
Cloud services aim to solve your problem, not give you low-level tools for you to do so on your own. Further, cloud services are extremely flexible, with most requiring no provisioning or long-term contracts. Due to this, relying on these services allows you to scale up and down with no advanced notice or provisioning, while paying only for the resources you use in a given month.

There are many cloud providers out there, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Rackspace, DigitalOcean, and more. With so many competitors in the space, each of these companies must have its own take on how to best serve customers. It turns out that although each provides many similar products, the implementation and details of how these products work tends to vary quite a bit.

In this course, we will focus on AWS and GCP.

### What you will learn ###

In this section, you will learn some of the basics of AWS and GCP, being able to fully understand, deploy and configure different components in the cloud.

### Reading: ###

1. [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner 2019](https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/)

2. [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/)

5. [Learn GCP: Google Cloud Data Engineer Express Course!](https://globant.udemy.com/organization-manage/insight/1510852/)

→ [index](#index)

### Practice: ###

#### Before you begin ####

AWS counts with several cloud products with different purposes, which you can check in https://aws.amazon.com/products/. To make use of them, you first need to set up an AWS account.

##### Setting up an AWS account #####

Setting up an account on AWS is pretty self-explanatory.

1) Visit https://aws.amazon.com/ and click the yellow *Create an AWS Account* button on the right.
2) You're then prompted to register a new account (unless you already have one)
3) Enter login credentials
4) Enter contact information
5) Enter payment information. You will only be billed if your usage exceeds that permitted within the free tier. For more info, visit https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/account-billing/.
6) You'll then be prompted to verify your identity by accepting a voice phone call from AWS where you’ll have to type a code into your phone that will be displayed on the computer.
7) Select a support plan: choose basic (free)
8) Once you receive confirmation, you can go ahead and log into the console!

##### Billing Alarm #####

As you know, AWS offers you a pay-as-you-go approach to help ensure you only pay for what you use on the software solutions you need. The idea of this course is not to waste any money, so, follow this instructions to set a billing alarm (so that you receive a notification as soon as you exceed either your free credits or the free usage tier limits, set the option, *When my total AWS charges for the month exceed* to $0).

You can always review your spend and Free tier Usage, choosing from the account menu My Billing Dashboard.

##### Free Tier #####

AWS free tier includes more than 60 products which you can easily start using. 

##### Usage #####

In order to check/update/delete your current components or create new ones, you have two options:
- Use the AWS management console / portal: access https://aws.amazon.com/console/, sign in to the console, find the services you want and make use of their corresponding visual interface.
- Use the AWS CLI: follow instructions in here, exposing your AWS credentials and interacting through the cli.

#### Exercices ####

*Note: previous steps are required in order to tackle the following exercises. Mind that, if skipping the billing alarm step and registering your credit card, you are in risk of spending money.
Try to always use the same AWS region, such as us-east-1.*

##### Lambda #####

1) Create a Lambda function called da-training-gateway-lambda-function. 
- Choose the Author from scratch option
- Choose Python3.7 as the Runtime 
- Create a proper role.
2) Edit code inline in order to print “Hi X! Current time is: Z”, being X a random name and Z current time.
3) Execute lambda function and check results are ok.
4) Create a scheduler to run your lambda function once a minute.
5) Deactivate previous scheduler

##### API Gateway #####

1) Create an API Gateway called da-training-api-gateway:
- Choose the REST protocol.
- New API
- Regional endpoint type
2) Create a POST method and link it with the previously created lambda function
3) Use Postman or any other REST client to hit the created API gateway url and check the result is ok
4) (Optional) Add an API Key:
- Associate it with the previous resource, making it mandatory
- Check that the previous POST request returns 403
- Add the created API Key in your request as a x-api-key header

##### S3 #####

1) Create an S3 bucket called da-training-bucket
2) Upload some sample images and json files to the bucket, using both the AWS management console and the AWS cli
3) Use AWS cli to download the bucket content
4) Change previously created lambda function in order to return the content of a JSON file uploaded in the S3 bucket
5) Repeat the POST operation hitting the API gateway and checking the JSON is returned.

##### EC2 #####

1) Create a t2.micro EC2 instance. (follow this tutorial if needed).
Choose the Amazon Linux AMI (free-tier eligible).
- 2GB storage.
- Create and save a key pair to be able to ssh the instance.
2) Connect to your instance via ssh.
3) Install python on your instance
4) Copy a local python project into your instance via scp
5) Try to start up the project in the EC2 instance and expose it through a certain port
6) Try to access the service in the EC2 instance from your local computer browser, using the ec2InstanceIp:exposedPort (You may need to make some changes in the instance Security group configuration, exposing http/https ports)

*2. What are the advantages of cloud? Which problems does it solve/avoid?*

*3. Is it always a good idea to develop/maintain/migrate your products to the cloud? If not, when is it a good option and when it is not? (Consider costs, expertise, project dimensions, etc)*

*4. Which are some of the cloud different providers? Do they offer different products?*

*5. What does the concept of serverless mean?*

*6. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS.. what does each of these mean? Could you name an implementation for each both in GCP and AWS?*

*7. What does Pay as you go mean? Investigate costs for lambdas and S3. Is there any difference with EC2 instances?*

*8. How would you design a simple Web App in the cloud? (include products to use, flow diagrams, costs, etc, in AWS or in GCP). Consider just static files.*

*9. How can we test a cloud infrastructure? Are there different type of tests that we can develop? Which tools would you use? Consider chaos testing.*

*10. How can we secure our infrastructure? Investigate role creation and assignment. Security groups. Policies. Authentication and Authorization. Routing (Ingress and Egress)*

*11. How can we monitor our infrastructure in the cloud? Consider logs and dashboards. What does KPI stand for?*

*12. Which products are there available for batch processing? And for analytics?*

*13. Load balancing and service discovery. Read about these concepts and how they can be easily implemented in the cloud.*

*14. Real-time queues. Investigate what each of the providers offer related to this, limitations, costs, etc.*

*15. How can we make deployments to the cloud? Investigate tools such as CloudFormation and Terraform and name the advantages of declarative languages and immutable infrastructures. Consider different environments (sandbox, dev, qa, prod, etc)*
